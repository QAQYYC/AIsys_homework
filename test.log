    OPT   This kernel exhibits low compute throughput and memory bandwidth utilization relative to the peak performance 
          of this device. Achieved compute throughput and/or memory bandwidth below 60.0% of peak typically indicate    
          latency issues. Look at Scheduler Statistics and Warp State Statistics for potential reasons.

          Threads are executed in groups of 32 threads called warps. This kernel launch is configured to execute 1      
          threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are       
          unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256      
          threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one      
          large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to
